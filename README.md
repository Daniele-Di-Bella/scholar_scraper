# scholar_scraper

## Overview

`scholar_scraper` is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to scrape academic papers and articles 
from Google Scholar. I created it to practice with some python libraries like `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` and `Click`. I took this project as an occasion to put myself to test also with TOML and with the implementation of Google Gemini in a Python project.
